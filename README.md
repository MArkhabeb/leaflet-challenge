# leaflet-challenge

For this challenge we were tasked with visualizing an earthquake dataset.

Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and choose a dataset to visualize.

Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Your data markers should reflect the magnitued of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when it's associated marker is clicked.

Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
